      <p>
        My family loves to travel. Our adventure really started in 2007, and since then we
        have gone to 4 different countries and 6 states (numbers keep growing!)

  <h4>2012 - Sweden & France</h4>
  <p>
    In september of 2012, 3 of us went to Europe for the first time (at least for
    my brother and I). We met up with my grandmother and uncle in Paris and spent 5
    days there. We went to a bunch of museums and tourist spots.
    That weekend we hopped over to Stockholm, Sweden, for my mom's cousin's wedding.
    It was a beautiful and exciting wedding. We got to see a bit of the viking side
    of Sweden too while exploring. The whole family was there!

  <h4>2013 - US: Washington DC</h4>
  <p>
    In 2013, we started our family tradition of visiting DC every Memorial Day
    weekend. It's impossible to see everything in just 3 days which is why we kept
    coming back. About 3 years later though, we had our fair share of DC and
    adventured elsewhere.

  <h4>2015 - Puerto Rico</h4>
  <p>
    Our new tradition spawned in 2015 when we left the mainland over to Puerto Rico.
    The island was very small! However, it was full of adventure. We drove ATVs through
    the rough terrain, not a single building in sight. The ocean on one side, and
    never ending stones and hills on the other.
    </p>
  <h4>2016 - Aruba</h4>
  <p>
    We are American citizens now! Which means we can go <em>anywhere!</em> (We went
    to Sweden on a technicality). That Christmas, we went to Aruba. It was great
    because the island is only a 30 minute flight from Venezuela, so our family
    was able to meet us there. We hadn't seen them in quite a while. The water
    was so clear! We went snorkling by a small island off the main island. It was all
    very relaxing.

  <h4>2017 - Spain</h4>
  <p>
    A month before graduating high school, my parents' graduation gift for me
    was a trip to... anywhere I wanted... with my best friend! We settled on Madrid,
    and spent a little less than a week there. We walked A LOT. We saw a bullfight! We
    visited Segova, a decent train ride away from Madrid, and ate very delicious food.
    We also have some family and friends there so we got to see them too.
    </p>
  <h4>2019 - COMING SOON</h4>
  <p>
    The year is not over and neither are my adventures! This fall I will be living
    abroad in Hong Kong for almost three months. However, I am not coming straight
    back to the US. It looks like there will be one more stop at the end of the
    semester... we'll see!
